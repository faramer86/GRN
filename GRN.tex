\chapter*{Building Gene Regulatory Network: experimental approach}
\section*{Introduction}

Developmental gene regulatory networks (dGRNs) plays a crucial role in the development of every single individual, especially multicellular. 
They regulate developmental processes not only during embryogenesis, but also affect post-embrionic morphogenetic processes like regeneration, asexual reproduction and growth.

GRN can be viewed as highly complicated network of protein-gene interactions. 
As a proteins in most of the cases act transcription factors (TFs). 
TFs are the proteins which has special DNA-binding motifs in their structure. 
This allows them to bind to regulatory elements in adjacent to gene regions (cis-regulatory modules) and regulate gene expression.
Depending on type of the interaction (activation/repression) there are can be several outcomes.
If TF binds to enchancer region, gene expression increase.
Opposite to that, if protein binds to silencer region then gene decrease its expression.
Also there can be more complicated types of interaction. 
For example protein could be insulator, enhancer-blocker or a barrier.
As a result most of the processes during development can be seen as complex network with lots of different gene-protein interactions.
Such networks usually illustrated using graphs.  
Nodes shows genes, TFs or signal molecules, edges illustrate types of interaction.
Such graphs in some cases reach vary big complexity.
As a consequense here arise a questions: how can we reconstruct such networks? 
What kind of data should we use? 
And what are the potencial outcomes from reasearch of such gene interactions?

The purpose of this review was to understand and demonstrate different approaches in building gene regulatory networks.
Special attention was paid to developmental GRNs.  

\section*{Developmental gene regulatory networks}

Term developmental gene regulatory networks (dGRNs) was first introduced by E. H. Davidson.
Usually this term refers to a GRN which preferentially consists of genes crucial for development. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

Developmental GRNs share lots of common features with other types of gene networks.
For example lots of networks typically has the same recurring regulation patterns as positive autoregulation (PAR), negative autoregulation (NAP), feedforward loops (FFLs) etc.
This common patterns called network motifs.
It is recurring circuits of interactions from which the gene networks are built.
Also usually GRNs have hierarchical structure.
That means those genes that control the initial stages of development are at the top of the hierarchy and those genes that execute the detailed functions of cell differentiation are at the periphery.
Consequently, changes in upstream genes have far larger effect than in downstream.
For example changes in gap genes in early development of \textit{Drosofila melanogaster} have more impact on final body plan than changes in genes which regulate eyes pigmentation.
There are lots of similarities between different GRNs.
But at the same time developmental GRNs have their own characteristic features.

First of all, they tend to have longer cascades than some other GRNs.
It can be explained by the role of this cascades.
Often they require transduce signal through the whole process of development, through lots of cell generations.
That is why timescale of such process is very slow.
Sometimes it is one cell generation at each cascade step.
And that brings us to the second characteristic feature of developmental GRNs.

They can functioning even after input signal has vanished.
The signal can be inherited during cell division and subsequent be transduced to next cell generations.
In the developmental processes often uses repressor cascades.
Since they are more tolerant to concentration biases of signal molecule.
Signal inheritance occures because of positive-feedback loops (PFLs).
PFL is a process in which two events are mutually reinforcing each other.
There are two kind of PFLs: double-positive loop and a double-negative loop (fig. 1).

In doble-positive-feedback loop (fig.1a) when signal molecule Z is activated, proteins X and Y begin to be produced. 
And after that X and Y develop self-sustained loop in which each molecule activate their partner.
After that even if Z is discarded (dashed line), loop A-B continue existinig.

In doble-negative-feedback loop (fig.2a), initially, there is a high concentration of Y and it represes X.
After Z is activated, X is produced and Y is repressed.
As a result after deactivation of Z (dashed line) signal is transduced by X.
Y at the same moment is discarded.
Thus, the feedback implements a memory.
And that is why such time-consuming processes as development become possible.
