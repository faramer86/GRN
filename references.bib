abstract = {Animal development is an elaborate process programmed by genomic regulatory instructions. Regulatory genes encode transcription factors and signal molecules, and their expression is under the control of cis-regulatory modules that define the logic of transcriptional responses to the inputs of other regulatory genes. The functional linkages among regulatory genes constitute the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern cell specification and patterning in development. Constructing such networks requires identification of the regulatory genes involved and characterization of their temporal and spatial expression patterns. Interactions (activation/repression) among transcription factors or signals can be investigated by large-scale perturbation analysis, in which the function of each gene is specifically blocked. Resultant expression changes are then integrated to identify direct linkages, and to reveal the structure of the GRN. Predicted GRN linkages can be tested and verified by cis-regulatory analysis. The explanatory power of the GRN was shown in the lineage specification of sea urchin endomesoderm. Acquiring such networks is essential for a systematic and mechanistic understanding of the developmental process.},

abstract = {Precise spatiotemporal gene expression during animal development is achieved through gene regulatory networks, in which sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) bind to cis-regulatory elements of target genes. Although numerous cis-regulatory elements have been identified in a variety of systems, their global architecture in the gene networks that regulate animal development is not well understood. Here, we determined the structure of the core networks at the cis-regulatory level in early embryos of the chordate Ciona intestinalis by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of 11 TFs. The regulatory systems of the 11 TF genes examined were tightly interconnected with one another. By combining analysis of the ChIP data with the results of previous comprehensive analyses of expression profiles and knockdown of regulatory genes, we found that most of the previously determined interactions are direct. We focused on cis-regulatory networks responsible for the Ciona mesodermal tissues by examining how the networks specify these tissues at the level of their cis-regulatory architecture. We also found many interactions that had not been predicted by simple gene knockdown experiments, and we showed that a significant fraction of TF-DNA interactions make major contributions to the regulatory control of target gene expression.},

abstract = {Inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression data at whole genome level is still an arduous challenge, especially in higher organisms where the number of genes is large but the number of experimental samples is small. It is reported that the accuracy of current methods at genome scale significantly drops from Escherichia coli to Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to the increase in number of genes. This limits the applicability of current methods to more complex genomes, like human and mouse. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is widely used for gene regulatory network inference from gene expression profiles. However, the accuracy of LASSO on large genomes is not satisfactory. In this study, we apply two extended models of LASSO, L0and L1/2regularization models to infer gene regulatory network from both high-throughput gene expression data and transcription factor binding data in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We find that both the L0and L1/2regularization models significantly outperform LASSO in network inference. Incorporating interactions between transcription factors and their targets remarkably improved the prediction accuracy. Current study demonstrates the efficiency and applicability of these two models for gene regulatory network inference from integrative omics data in large genomes. The applications of the two models will facilitate biologists to study the gene regulation of higher model organisms in a genome-wide scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a well-recognized model for the study of vertebrate developmental genetics, yet at the same time little is known about the transcriptional events that underlie zebrafish embryogenesis. Here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis. Transcriptome analysis at 12 different embryonic time points covering five different developmental stages (maternal, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, and pharyngula) revealed a highly dynamic transcriptional profile. Hierarchical clustering, stage-specific clustering, and algorithms to detect onset and peak of gene expression revealed clearly demarcated transcript clusters with maximum gene activity at distinct developmental stages as well as co-regulated expression of gene groups involved in dedicated functions such as organogenesis. Our study also revealed a previously unidentified cohort of genes that are transcribed prior to the mid-blastula transition, a time point earlier than when the zygotic genome was traditionally thought to become active. Here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis, including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes. The expression data generated from this study are accessible to all interested scientists from our institute resource database (http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/{\~{}}govind/zebrafish/data{\_}download.html).},

However, the impact of such data is not fully exploited due to a limited availability of multi-omic data integration tools and methods. In this paper, we discuss the interplay between gene expression and epigenetic markers/transcription factors. We show how integrating ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data can help to elucidate gene regulatory mechanisms. In particular, we discuss the two following questions: i) Can transcription factor occupancies or histone modification data predict gene expression? ii) Can ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data be used to infer gene regulatory networks? We propose potential directions for statistical data integration. We discuss the importance of incorporating underestimated aspects (such as alternative splicing and long-range chromatin interactions). We also highlight the lack of data benchmarks and the need to develop tools for data integration from a statistical viewpoint, designed in the spirit of reproducible research.},

Descriptive and mathematical models for gene regulatory networks can reveal emergent properties of these plant systems.
